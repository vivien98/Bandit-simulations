# MultiArmedBandit-simulations

##Code description :
 
 diffEqn.m : solution of the urn based model via ODE
 
 polya.py :  n arms,n users , changing user preferences (model changed to be polya urn based)
 
 extern.py : n arms,n users , changing user preferences 
 
 graph.py : side information via graph of users and arms. Tests and compares UCB and thompson sampling
 
 rewardOptimize.m : Calculates policy that gives us the maximum equilibrium reward, gives graph of ewuilibrium reward vs policy
